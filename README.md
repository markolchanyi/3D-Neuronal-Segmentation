# 3D-Neuronal-Segmentation
Faster 3D segmentation algorithm ideal image stacks of cortical neurones. Using slice-by-slice canny edge detection followed by two-pass component labelling. Parallel Soma detection using openCV's Hough Circle detection. Manual inputs required for min soma area, threshold, and circularity. Example _run script included.
